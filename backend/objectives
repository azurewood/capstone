MINI-PROJECT 3 - Project objectives

1. 
My first objective is to utilize the weather API and build a backend to cache data for it.
2.
Then I will improve the functionaility to facilite weather checking for New Zealand by incorperating with geographic data.
3.
The end goal is to present weather information for a region by just one click, such as Otago. To do so, I have to parse geographic data and oragnize it in backend database with API support. I will use online data from the United Nations. 

After adding areas, distance and forced fresh queries, the backend is more like a full-fledged API now for NZ users.
